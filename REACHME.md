This web app was made Javascript. Its purpose is to show off my week one knowledge from Epicodus of object oriented Javascript, and building Gulp files. This doctor lookup is an app designed to give the user the ability to see a list of doctors in the area based on the symptoms they enter in the search bar as well as details about them.

## Planning

### 1. Configuration/dependencies
  The app will primarily use Javascript and my knowledge of API's to create a local doctor search app for the Portland, OR area. It was made with what I learned from the week one Javascript track at Epicodus.

### 2. User Stories
  * As a user, I'd like to be able to enter my symptoms and have search results tailored to my needs.
  * As a user, I'd like to visit a page to see a list of all qualified doctors in area.
  * As a user, I'd like to see their information including their name, title and a little explanation about them.

### 3. UX/UI
  * SASS
